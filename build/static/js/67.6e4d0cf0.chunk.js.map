Word that\n            this discussion was happening spread, and within months, dozens of\n            people from all over the state—people from non-profits, the\n            corrections system, social service agencies, faith based\n            organizations, law enforcement, recovery services, formerly and\n            currently incarcerated, and more—began attending and contributing to\n            these monthly meetings.\n          </p>\n          <br />\n          <p>\n            It became apparent that there are numerous organizations(silos)\n            doing amazing work assisting returning citizens, but most did not\n            know each other, or how their work fit into the bigger picture of\n            coordinated re-entry services.\n          </p>\n          <br />\n          <p>\n            Rather than continue to have people from as far away continue to\n            come to Auburn every month, MPRN Founder, Bruce Noddin, decided to\n            start holding meetings in other cities throughout Maine, so more\n            people could learn about the resources, develop relationships, and\n            create a team approach to re-entry in their community.\n          </p>\n        </Info>\n      </Content>\n      <Content>\n        <Info>\n          <AUHeading>\n            <h1>The Maine Prisoner Advocacy Coalition (MPAC)</h1>\n          </AUHeading>\n          <a>https://www.maineprisoneradvocacy.org/</a>\n          <p>\n            The Maine Prisoner Advocacy Coalition (MPAC) is committed to\n            ethical, <br />\n            positive, and humane changes in Maine's prison system.\n          </p>\n          <br />\n          <p>\n            Our Mission is to support and advocate for Maine’s incarcerated\n            citizens, their families and friends. <br />\n            Our Purpose is to reduce Maine’s use of incarceration by advocating\n            for a legal system that is ethical, humane, and restorative. <br />\n            Our Vision is of a justice system that is restorative. It supports\n            humanity in every person, and reflects and creates transformation\n            and accountability.\n          </p>\n          <br />\n          <p>\n            Today, MPAC is continuing the mission of our founders. Every day our\n            staff is engaging with incarcerated individuals or their families\n            about challenges they are encountering. Every day our staff and\n            volunteers directly advocate for, and support people as they\n            negotiate the trauma-filled environments of our legal system. Every\n            day we support incarcerated individuals as they prepare for the\n            transition to reenter society. Every day our staff and volunteers\n            are supporting someone negotiating reentry to help them overcome a\n            barrier of lifetime sanctions. Join us to support this vital work\n            and help us reach our fundraising goal of $25,000.
