          <p>
            Our History: NAMI was formed in 1977 when two mothers, each with a
            son with schizophrenia, met over lunch to discuss their shared
            experiences and challenges. At a second lunch the women decided to
            assemble people with similar concerns.

          <p>
            NAMI Maine offers compassion and provides social/emotional support

            improved quality of services for all persons affected by mental
            illness. NAMI Maine educates, inform, and provide resources for and
            about mental illness, raises public awareness and promote
            understanding of mental illness, promotes the importance of peer

            In June of 2017, 5 people gathered together at the Catholic
            Charities office in Auburn, Maine to discuss how they might support
            citizens returning to the community after incarceration. Word that
            this discussion was happening spread, and within months, dozens of
            people from all over the state—people from non-profits, the
            corrections system, social service agencies, faith based
            organizations, law enforcement, recovery services, formerly and
            currently incarcerated, and more—began attending and contributing to
            these monthly meetings.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            It became apparent that there are numerous organizations(silos)
            doing amazing work assisting returning citizens, but most did not
            know each other, or how their work fit into the bigger picture of
            coordinated re-entry services.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Rather than continue to have people from as far away continue to
            come to Auburn every month, MPRN Founder, Bruce Noddin, decided to
            start holding meetings in other cities throughout Maine, so more
            people could learn about the resources, develop relationships, and
            create a team approach to re-entry in their community.

            The Maine Prisoner Advocacy Coalition (MPAC) is committed to
            ethical, <br />
            positive, and humane changes in Maine's prison system.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Our Mission is to support and advocate for Maine’s incarcerated
            citizens, their families and friends. <br />
            Our Purpose is to reduce Maine’s use of incarceration by advocating
            for a legal system that is ethical, humane, and restorative. <br />
            Our Vision is of a justice system that is restorative. It supports
            humanity in every person, and reflects and creates transformation
            and accountability.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Today, MPAC is continuing the mission of our founders. Every day our
            staff is engaging with incarcerated individuals or their families
            about challenges they are encountering. Every day our staff and
            volunteers directly advocate for, and support people as they
            negotiate the trauma-filled environments of our legal system. Every
            day we support incarcerated individuals as they prepare for the
            transition to reenter society. Every day our staff and volunteers
            are supporting someone negotiating reentry to help them overcome a
            barrier of lifetime sanctions. Join us to support this vital work
            and help us reach our fundraising goal of $25,000. To donate please
